1. Alondra Reyes – 29, Female, Los Angeles, CA
   Alondra is a bilingual (Spanish/English) marketing coordinator at a boutique music label in downtown LA. Outgoing and creative, she thrives on collaboration but needs weekend downtime to recharge. Her workday starts late—she checks emails around 10am and often works until 7 or 8pm, especially when prepping for album launches or events. She loves fast-paced, urban travel with good nightlife, and tends to follow food bloggers to find trendy spots—Korean-Mexican fusion is her current obsession. Alondra uses casual language in emails (even with her boss) and is quick with texts, often replying within minutes, filled with emojis and voice notes. She plans trips around music festivals or friend visits, and her quirky ritual is to color-match her outfits with each destination.

2. Marcus Chen – 48, Male, Minneapolis, MN
   Marcus is a pediatrician and father of two teenagers, living in a quiet suburb of Minneapolis. Thoughtful and meticulous, he balances a structured work schedule with a calm, family-centered home life. He works 4 days a week at the clinic, with one day reserved for administrative work from home. Summer is his most flexible season; winter months are packed with school activities and hospital shifts. He prefers serene, nature-heavy vacations—national parks, cabin retreats, or road trips through scenic byways—and prioritizes locations where the whole family can unplug. Marcus writes thorough, professional emails and typically responds within 24 hours. Texts are brief and functional, unless he’s messaging his kids. A unique trait: he builds itineraries backwards, starting with the departure time and planning in reverse to ensure nothing gets rushed.

3. Simone Hartfield – 35, Nonbinary (they/them), New Orleans, LA
   Simone is a tattoo artist and muralist based in New Orleans’ Bywater neighborhood. Charismatic and intuitive, they live a nonlinear life—work hours shift depending on client demand, inspiration, and weather (since some of their murals are outdoors). They’re active in the local arts scene and often collaborate on creative events or community projects. Simone loves immersive travel with local flavor—food markets, indie galleries, street performers—and favors destinations off the beaten path. They’re most available mid-week and avoid scheduling anything before noon. Email feels impersonal to them; they check it maybe twice a week. Most of their communication happens through Instagram DMs and iMessage, where their replies are thoughtful but delayed unless urgent.

4. Jordan Patel – 23, Male, Boston, MA
   Jordan is a recent college graduate working as a software engineer at a robotics startup in Boston. Inquisitive and slightly neurotic, he’s still adjusting to adult routines and fluctuates between over-planning and spontaneous decision-making. His day begins early with stand-ups at 9am, followed by long coding sessions fueled by iced coffee. He uses Google Calendar religiously and blocks time for even casual hangouts. Jordan prefers tech-forward urban destinations or cities with rich transportation systems—Tokyo and Berlin are his dream trips. He’s a picky eater, gravitating toward Indian food and ramen. Email etiquette is still a work in progress for him—he uses too many exclamation marks with clients—and he replies to texts instantly unless he’s debugging. He periodically texts his parents. He often overcommits and double-books, then scrambles to cancel or reschedule.

5. Cheryl Dawson – 61, Female, Asheville, NC
   Cheryl is a retired public librarian who now runs a part-time online bookstore specializing in rare children’s literature. Kind, grounded, and fiercely independent, she spends her mornings hiking in the Blue Ridge Mountains with her husband, and her afternoons tending to her online orders or hosting a neighborhood book club. She avoids travel during winter and prefers shoulder seasons when places are less crowded. Her dream trips involve quaint towns, historical landmarks, and botanical gardens. She detests rushed itineraries and prefers slow, meaningful travel where she can journal and sketch. Cheryl’s email style is old-school—formal, proofread, and usually sent from her desktop. Texts are short and sparse; she checks her phone only a few times a day. She often sends postcards when traveling.
